This sub-project is directed at users of the DICOM-rs ecosystem. It provides a high-level
abstraction to DICOM objects, enabling objects to be retrieved from files or
['readers'](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html), and then analysed as a tree
of attributes.

This crate is part of the [DICOM-rs](https://github.com/Enet4/dicom-rs) project
and is contained by the parent crate [`dicom`](https://crates.io/crates/dicom).
