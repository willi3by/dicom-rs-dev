//! Core module for building pixel data adapters.
//! 
//! This module contains the core types and traits
//! for consumers and implementers of
//! transfer syntaxes with encapsulated pixel data.
//! 
//! Complete DICOM object types
//! (such as `FileDicomObject<InMemDicomObject>`)
//! implement the [`PixelDataObject`] trait.
//! Transfer syntaxes need to provide
//! a suitable implementation of [PixelRWAdapter]
