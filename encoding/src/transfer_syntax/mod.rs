//! Module containing the DICOM Transfer Syntax data structure and related methods.
//! Similar to the DcmCodec in DCMTK, the `TransferSyntax` contains all of the necessary
//! algorithms for decoding and encoding DICOM data in a certain transfer syntax.
//!
//! This crate does not host specific transfer syntaxes. Instead, they are created in
//! other crates and registered in the global transfer syntax registry, which implements
//! [`TransferSyntaxIndex`][1].
//! For more information, please see the [`dicom-transfer-syntax-registry`] crate,
//! which provides built-in implementations.
//!
//! This module allows you to register your own transfer syntaxes.
//! With the `inventory-registry` Cargo feature,
//! you can use the macro [`submit_transfer_syntax`]
//! to instruct the compiler to include your implementation in the registry.
//! Without the `inventory`-based registry
//! (in case your environment does not support it),
//! you can still roll your own [transfer syntax index][1].
